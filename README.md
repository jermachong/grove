## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Virtual environment (recommended)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd tech-elect
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

Use the provided shell script for easy execution:

```bash
# Show help
./tech_elect_map --help

# Basic usage - show all courses with statistics
./tech_elect_map courses.pdf --stats

# Filter by major and academic level
./tech_elect_map courses.pdf --major CpE --undergrad

# Search for specific topics
./tech_elect_map courses.pdf --search "machine learning" --verbose

# Check eligible courses based on completed coursework
./tech_elect_map courses.pdf --completed-file my_courses.txt --eligible

# Generate statistics and export to CSV
./tech_elect_map courses.pdf --stats --output results.csv
```

Alternatively, use Python directly:

```bash
.venv/bin/python tech_elect_cli.py courses.pdf [options]
```

## Command Line Options

```
positional arguments:
  pdf_file              Path to the technical electives PDF file

options:
  -h, --help            Show help message and exit
  -u, --undergrad       Show only undergraduate courses
  -g, --graduate        Show only graduate courses
  -m, --major {EE,CpE,CS,IT,EE2,CpE1,EE3}
                        Filter by major
  --search SEARCH       Search courses by keyword
  --completed-file COMPLETED_FILE
                        File containing completed courses
  --eligible            Show only eligible courses (requires --completed-file)
  -v, --verbose         Show detailed course information
  -s, --stats           Show course statistics
  --output OUTPUT       Export results to CSV file
```

## Completed Courses File Format

Create a text file listing your completed courses:

**One per line:**

```
EEL 3123C
EEL 3801C
EEE 3342C
COP 3503C
```

**Comma-separated:**

```
EEL 3123C, EEL 3801C, EEE 3342C, COP 3503C, EGN 3211
```

## Examples

### Find Machine Learning Courses

```bash
./tech_elect_map courses.pdf --search "machine learning" --verbose
```

### Check Eligible CpE Undergraduate Courses

```bash
./tech_elect_map courses.pdf --completed-file my_courses.txt --eligible --major CpE --undergrad
```

### Generate Complete Course Statistics

```bash
./tech_elect_map courses.pdf --stats --output course_analysis.csv
```

### Search for VLSI-related Courses

```bash
./tech_elect_map courses.pdf --search "VLSI" --verbose
```

## Output Features

- **Color-coded status**: ‚úÖ Success, ‚ùå Error, ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning
- **Formatted tables**: Clean, aligned course information
- **Prerequisite parsing**: Automatically extracts and displays prerequisites
- **Eligibility checking**: Shows which courses you can take based on completed work
- **CSV export**: Export filtered results for spreadsheet analysis

## Supported Majors

- **EE**: Electrical Engineering
- **CpE**: Computer Engineering
- **CS**: Computer Science
- **IT**: Information Technology
- **EE2, EE3**: Specialized EE tracks
- **CpE1**: Specialized CpE track

## Troubleshooting

### Virtual Environment Issues

If you get "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pymupdf'":

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install PyMuPDF
```

### Permission Issues

If the shell script isn't executable:

```bash
chmod +x tech_elect_map
```

### PDF Parsing Issues

Ensure your PDF file is readable and contains structured course information. The tool expects course codes in formats like "EEL 3123C" or "CAP 4630".
